NAME

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to check Dattebayos torrent tracker using Perl.
    Its list() method will return the complete list of files and their
    attributes.

    WWW::Dattebayo uses LWP::UserAgent as its base class. So you can use all
    methods from LWP::UserAgent on WWW::Dattebayo. This allows you to handle
    your proxies, etc... directly via LWP.

    PLEASE NOTE: Thou shalt not request the list() method every minute.
    Dattebayo is a large fansub group and they take the internet seriously.
    Their release schedule is really simple. So it should be fair enough if
    you call the method only when you need it.

        attributes listed on http://www.dattebayo.com/t/. Make sure to read
